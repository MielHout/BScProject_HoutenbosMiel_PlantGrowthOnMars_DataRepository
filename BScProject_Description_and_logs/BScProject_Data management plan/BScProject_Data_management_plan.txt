Data Management Plan

1. Types of data
a. The project generates experimental and observational data. These include:
- Quantitative plant growth measurements (shoot/root length, fresh/dry biomass)
- Qualitative observations (nodule formation, seedling health)
- Digital images (JPEG) of plants over time 
- Digital images (JPEG) of final plant tissues
- Soil pH measurements (numeric)
- Germination records under different atmospheric conditions

b. Measurement levels:
- Continuous data (e.g. shoot length in mm, biomass in mg).
- Categorical data (e.g. inoculated vs. uninoculated; nodule color).
- Binary data (e.g. germinated: yes/no).

c. Data were collected through:
- Manual measurement with rulers and lab scales
- Soil pH measured using calibrated Mettler Toledo S220 pH meter for pH readings.
- Digital images captured using a consistent smartphone camera setup
- Atmospheric data from a modified Miller-Urey chamber
- Data were entered and processed in Microsoft Excel and analyzed in R (v4.3.1)

2. Contextual details (Metadata)
a. File naming convention:  
[treatment/plantID]_[file type].ext  
Example: PlantTreatment_data.csv or MMS2Rhizo_plantphoto1.jpg


b. File formats used:
- .csv for spreadsheets and numerical data
- .jpg for plant photographs
- .mp4 for plant growth over time (screenshots of exact plant growth by day editted in pdf table)
- .pdf for image tables
- .txt for metadata and documentation
- .R for analysis scripts

3. Quality control
a. Data accuracy was ensured by:
- Double-checking entries during measurement
- Keeping digital data and notebook data
- Consistent use of units and measurement tools
- ensuring quality of pictures taken

b. Quality control roles:
- The student (author) performed primary checks
- Supervisor periodically checked in 

4. Storage, backup and security
a. Final data will be made publicly available on Zenodo with DOI: [insert DOI when available]  
b. All data were backed up daily via cloud sync (OneDrive) and local storage on an external hard drive

5. Copyright and reuse
a. Copyright is held by the student author, under guidance of the University of Amsterdam  
b. Data may be reused for educational or research purposes with proper citation. Upon submission, it will be shared with the supervisor and examiners; after graduation, the dataset may be uploaded to Zenodo.

6. Protection and privacy
a. Not applicable â€“ no personal, sensitive, or identifiable human or animal data involved. No ethical or privacy concerns apply.
