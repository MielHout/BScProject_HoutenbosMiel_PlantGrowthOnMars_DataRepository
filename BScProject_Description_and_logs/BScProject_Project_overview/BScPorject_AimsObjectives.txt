AIMS
- To investigate whether Lotus japonicus, a model legume, can grow and develop under simulated Martian conditions, including nutrient-poor regolith, high pH, and low-pressure atmosphere.
- To assess whether inoculation with nitrogen-fixing Mesorhizobium can enhance plant growth and symbiosis under these conditions.

OBJECTIVES
- To compare growth and biomass accumulation of L. japonicus on MMS-2 Martian soil simulant and nutrient-free quartz sand.
- To evaluate the effect of Mesorhizobium sp. LjRoot218 inoculation on nodulation and plant development.
- To determine the buffering capacity and pH behavior of MMS-2 and the feasibility of pH adjustment.
- To test the germination success of L. japonicus seeds in a simulated Mars-like atmosphere using a modified Miller-Urey system.

HYPOTHESES
- IF L. japonicus is grown on MMS-2, THEN it will show reduced growth and biomass compared to sand due to high pH and nutrient limitations.
- IF L. japonicus is inoculated with Mesorhizobium, THEN plant growth and nodulation will improve compared to uninoculated controls.
- IF MMS-2 is treated with acid or buffer, THEN pH will decrease until target pH is acquired
- IF L. japonicus seeds are exposed to a low-pressure Mars-like atmosphere, THEN germination rates will be lower than under Earth conditions and possibly entirely entirely inhibited.
