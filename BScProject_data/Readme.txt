DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

1. File List: 
- `Readme.txt`  
	This file.
- `BScProject_Raw_Data`  
	All manually collected plant growth measurements (shoot length, biomass, nodule 	counts) and soil pH data, in unprocessed form (Excel or CSV).
- `BScProject_Images_PlantGrowth`  
  	Plant growth image time series, organized by sample and date. photos of growth over time by treatment group and date of measurement, photos of plants and root nodules 	pesent, encircled with red. Still images of all individual plant replicates are 	collected in a table pdf.
- `BScProject_Germination_Setup`  
	Photos of the Miller-Urey chamber used to simulate low-pressure Mars-like 	conditions for germination and photos of results. Description of Miller-Urey setup 	and germination per treatment are displayed in "BScProject_Figures_Final"
- `BScProject_Figures_Final`  
	The final figures as used in the thesis and presentation, exported as PNG/PDF/JPEG.
